# **Modeling the Spread & Impact of COVID-19**

## COVID-19 Objective 
enable others to do something against COVID-19 which means the only guideline is to build tools and applications that enable others to fight against the Coronavirus.

A good example would be the tool [Sudharshan Ashok](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudharshanashok/) built called [pyCOVID](https://github.com/sudharshan-ashok/pycovid) a Python package to pull CASE data from the John Hopkins dataset. This Python package acts as an enabler to others on developing their projects.

* Graph Queries (GSQL)

> Contribute code directly to COVID-19 Repository or add component to COVID-19/Awesome.md list 

### Why it’s important to load data into graph
Short read on “[Why it’s important to connect data](http://coronavirus-a-serious-need-for-analyzing-connections/)” → We choose to use a graph database because we can interconnect all the data and make it available to the public via REST endpoints.

The threat of COVID-19 from spreading and affecting those around us, especially our loved ones that are over the age of 60+ with the exponential mortality rate of COVID 19 rising to 15% in those around the age of 80.

The biggest impact is not only the impact on the health around us, but the stability of the global economy itself.

**Proposal:**
Build the world's richest inter-connected data set that allows the world's smartest researchers to build virus spread models, economic impact models, reporting dashboards, drug vaccine effectiveness models to supply-chain models.

## Spread Prediction:

### Transportation Data

Viruses spread through means of transportation. The biggest transportation networks are airlines. If we pull the last year of all flight data from every plane to every airport the flew in and out of. Along with the path of virus spread we may begin to identify where the

  

This data can be extracted from OpenSky API.

  

Open Sky Documentation

[https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/rest.html](https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/rest.html)
  

The missing data from open sky is the ICAO which are International Airport Codes

Sample Data - Pulled from Open Sky [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16NCKbgVTZIrBj-CasNI7ZycpBZdghJqp#scrollTo=b-flVhevP2IJ](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16NCKbgVTZIrBj-CasNI7ZycpBZdghJqp#scrollTo=b-flVhevP2IJ)

        [{
        'icao24': 'e48bb0',
        'firstSeen': 1517227957,
        'estDepartureAirport': 'SBSP',
        'lastSeen': 1517229087,
        'estArrivalAirport': None,
        'callsign': 'ONE6004 ',
        'estDepartureAirportHorizDistance': 5036,

        'estArrivalAirportVertDistance': None,
        'departureAirportCandidatesCount': 1,
        'arrivalAirportCandidatesCount': 0
	    }]
Data restrictions on pulling arrival and departure data is a two hour window. We will need to write a script to pull all the historical data in 2 hour chunks.

### Case Data

The most reliable case data is from John Hopkis whom is pulling World Health Organization data and publishing to their github repository: [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data)

  

Case data includes: Province/State, Country/Region ,Last Update, Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Latitude, Longitude

Genomic Drug Effectiveness:

Currently there are 113 submitted ARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) Sequences in the GenBank database. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/)

-   Setup Data Pipeline for Case data (Pull from source,Normalization, Push to TG)
    
-   Determine other data sources
    
-   Setup pipes to other data sources
    

  

**Database:**
